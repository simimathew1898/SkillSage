Entrepreneurial Apprentice Eccentric Millionaire,JLS Trading Co,,"full time, ecommerce, remote","<p dir=""ltr"">- Is learning new things like crack to you?</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Is the prospect of entrepreneurship exciting but also pretty scary, so you've opt for safer choices?</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that donât put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--Is this a real job ad?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And itâs not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - weâre big time, people.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - weâre a pretty big deal):</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/"">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">And check out our reviews on <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=JLS+Trading+Co%20Charlotte,%20NC"">Google</a>, <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-JLS-Trading-EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm"">Glassdoor</a>, or <a href=""https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-Co"">Indeed</a> to see that itâs not just the founderâs mother who says weâre cool.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--What do you guys do?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling):Â </p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">- Bad Parking Cards (<a href=""https://amz.run/5Eya"">https://amz.run/5Eya</a>)</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Beverage Barricades (<a href=""https://amz.run/6kip"">https://amz.run/6kip</a>)</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Child Chucker (<a href=""https://amz.run/9EUz"">https://amz.run/9EUz</a>)</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: <a href=""http://ppcfarm.com"">PPCFarm.com</a> (weâre really, really good at PPC)</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and itâs our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--What is your company like?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">1. You Can Be Yourself. You donât have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesnât matter what your credentials are â it matters what you get done.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we donât care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, weâre happy campers.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If youâre routinely working more than 45ish hours, youâre gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">6. No Micro-Management. Once youâre trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably arenât the place for you.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">8. Supportive Environment. We donât operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful â internal politics are at a minimum here.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">10. Weâll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. Youâll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. Weâve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">13. Self-Funded So We Can Do Whatâs Right for Us. We donât have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--What are your companyâs values?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">See here: <a href=""http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/"">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - itâs not just normal corporate BS. We promise youâll learn a lot about us.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--OK, so Iâve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">No.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--Wait... What?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">OK fine. Super short version:</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Learning like crazy in order to set you up to be an internal entrepreneur (intrapreneur) to take on some business opportunity.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">To prepare for entrepreneurship though, you are going to become a generalist. Our best people are almost all generalists, who can tackle any problem thrown at them. I want you to become one of them.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Another way of describing things is that youâre going to become the ultimate problem solver.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Weâre gonna test you, teach you, and put you on progressively harder projects as you gain skills and demonstrate capability. We might eventually ask you to:</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">- Go find a new vendor for X</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Recommend a solution for expanding our warehouse space</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Figure out the basics of marketing channel Y so we can hire for it</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Build a complex Google Sheets tool</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Create a video for product Z</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Launch our products on Amazon UK</p><p dir=""ltr"">- Figure out who we should talk to get into retail</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Things like that. There wonât generally be an SOP - youâre just gonna have to figure it out on your own.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">The ability to figure things out independently at a high level is a rare one, and the more people we have in the company with the ability, the better off weâll be.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">The ultimate goal is to give you a well-rounded education and then throw you at some mutually beneficial entrepreneurial opportunity that excites you.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--Why are you doing this?--</p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OYczRyLOxW9o-d6__AvCHkL3pfbUmOBo9zFsnnL74g/edit#"">Longer explanation here</a></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Hiring really good people is really, really hard. Weâve tried hiring senior people in the past and have failed almost every time. Whatâs worked in the past is hiring junior/mid-level folks, training them, and letting them run free. So, we formalized this into an official apprentice program which has worked out wonderfully.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--Why do you need internal entrepreneurs?--</p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://vimeo.com/1100110120/9b6df1a289?share=copy"">Video of our founder explaining the situation/opportunity some more.</a></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--Do I need experience?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You complete buffoon.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for an apprentice position... sickening. Iâm literally shaking right now.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Also, no you don't need any experience.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">We want special people, and donât give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">The Big Bang requirement still stands though.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--Do I need a college degree?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">You just need to be awesome.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--Is this just for beginners?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">Definitely not. We have amazing apprentices of all ages and experience levels, and this is no exception.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--Are there any geographic restrictions?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">As long as you are in a country that doesnât have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isnât known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, soâ¦</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--This sounds completely ridiculous and fake--</p><p dir=""ltr"">Definitely fair. Check us out online and decide for yourself.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Spoiler: Itâs not fake, weâre just led by a crazy person (he insists on âeccentric,â but we all know what that really means).</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--This sounds pretty good, though Iâm still skeptical that this isnât a pyramid scheme.--</p><p dir=""ltr"">You sound just like the tax authorities!</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">--That doesnât resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--</p><p dir=""ltr"">Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Once youâre in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely donât want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you âyesâ or ânoâ, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!</p><br/><br/>Please mention the word **QUALIFIED** and tag RMzguNjguMTM0LjE5NA== when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMzguNjguMTM0LjE5NA==).

Today, mortgage lenders are stuck running their companies on software products built 20 years ago. These products are slow, unstable and donât lead to material improvements in efficiency. When using these systems, the average human cost to originate a loan is still over $11,000.</p><p>Loancrate builds AI native tooling to automate mortgage workflows. Our ultimate goal is fully automated origination, which has the potential to save lenders over $16B in operating expense per year.</p><p>Since starting in 2020, our remote team has enabled our customers to power &gt;$85 billion in new home loans. We are a group of people excited to tackle the complexity of the home-lending industry. We care about collaboration, very open communication covering the good &amp; the bad so that we learn from our decisions quickly, and ultimately having fun while we're building. You'll fit in well if you like diving deep quickly!</p><p><br /></p><h1><strong>The Opportunity</strong></h1><p>Our dreams are big and we have much to build! We're looking for senior software engineers to help lead our team in powering the future of home buying in the US (which could entail managing a majority of US home loans every year â financial assets worth trillions of dollars).</p><p>We are excited to offer competitive salary and equity for this role.</p><p><br /></p><h1><strong>What To Expect</strong></h1><p>As an engineer at Loancrate, you'll continue our team tradition by shipping code to production on your first day! Following that, within your first month, you'll dive into your first mission-critical project, such as...</p><p>ð Architecting, building, and launching complex, multi-step AI agents that our customers use to digitize their ops workflows and save millions of dollars per year.</p><p>ð¤ Integrating with 3rd-party providers of lending services APIs to generate documents/disclosures, produce automated underwriting results, or prevent fraud.</p><p>ð Architecting, building, and launching the next generation of our job processing infrastructure on AWS to make Loancrate's back end more observable and reliable.</p><p><br /></p><h1><strong>Tech Stack</strong></h1><p>Nearly all of our code is written in TypeScript. We use React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend (running inside Docker), GraphQL/Apollo on both sides, and Postgres as our database. We use AWS (ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, Kafka, ElasticSearch, and more) and manage all of our infrastructure with Terraform.</p><p>We believe that high engineering velocity drives high product velocity (and, in turn, our success as a company ð). Keeping this in mind, we've invested heavily in creating a great developer experience that enables engineers to ship fast. Some highlights of our stack:</p><p>âï¸ <strong>End-to-End Type Safety</strong> - We generate TypeScript types from our Postgres and GraphQL schemas so that when we change our database schema we see type errors in any incompatible frontend React components.</p><p>ð <strong>Full-Stack Code Sharing</strong> - Our build tooling supports seamless sharing of TypeScript files between the client, server, and other packages in our mono-repo so that we never have to define functions or configuration values twice.</p><p>ð  <strong>Reproducible Infrastructure</strong> - Weâve used Terraform to manage 100% of our infrastructure since day 1 and have configured our CI pipeline to automatically deploy temporary staging environments for every pull request. We use these per-PR environments to get feedback from teammates and test any infrastructure changes using infrastructure that's identical to production.</p><p>ð§ª <strong>First Class Testing Utilities</strong> - We have a comprehensive library of utilities that mock production-like data and feed automated end-to-end, integration, and performance tests. Our wide-ranging test suite allows us to move fast while maintaining nearly perfect uptime.</p><p><br /></p><h1><strong>Preferred Skills and Background</strong></h1><p><em>(It's okay not to have all of these things - these are just some skills we are excited about!)</em></p><p>ð¤ Familiarity with modern AI product development lifecycles (evals, experiment design, dataset curation, etc). We donât just build AI chat bots. We wrangle non-deterministic LLMs into reliable mission-critical systems.</p><p>ð A constant and keen eye for security risks â we store and display some of people's most sensitive personal data and need to keep it safe!</p><p>ð¨ A desire to be product-oriented, from thinking through the product implications of what you're building to contributing your unique ideas of how to improve the product.</p><p>ðï¸ Ability to develop readable, maintainable, and effective software architecture patterns that support use of our product by various enterprise customers (each with thousands of employees and their own methods for running their companies).</p><p>ð©âð«ð¨âð« Excitement to mentor less senior engineers in both hard and soft skills.</p><p>ð SRE-oriented mindset for developing infrastructure that's reliable, observable, and requires minimal toil to maintain.</p><p>ð©ï¸ Experience scaling high-throughput distributed systems in the cloud. Bonus points if you're experienced with infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform or CloudFormation!</p><p>ð§ Ability to develop full-stack web app features from design through deployment.</p><p>ð¢ï¸ Experience designing and scaling complex relational DB schemas, as well as figuring out performant ways to store, retrieve, and update such data. Home loans have thousands of data fields ð.</p><br/><br/>Please mention the word **WONDEROUSLY** and tag RMzguNjguMTM0LjE5NA== when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMzguNjguMTM0LjE5NA==).

Application Engineer,LaunchBrightly,,"engineer, dev, javascript, front end, api, graphql, vue, typescript, dynamodb","<p dir=""ltr"">At LaunchBrightly, we are on a mission to automate <a href=""https://launchbrightly.com/product.html"">a process that continually captures and enhances screenshots of all your SaaS product features</a>. The continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline and process that engineers adopted over the last decade, is what we ultimately want to build for customer support teams. TLDR; LaunchBrightly = Github Actions/Circle CI for customer support. And we are currently looking to bring onboard a strong <strong>Application Engineer</strong>.Â </p><p dir=""ltr"">Everyone at LaunchBrightly is a creator, an owner, or perhaps better, a celebration of the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. Most big companies are afraid of entrusting the future of the company and their software to a few makers, and as they defend against that, they end up with three layers of managers and a product designed by a committee. We want the opposite. We need the opposite as we enter virgin territory trying to build that CI/CD pipeline and process for the support organization. As our customer pushes a new feature to production, we automatically update all product images within the help center. This is a thrilling adventure!</p><p dir=""ltr"">Our work is remote, not distant. We believe that being a remote-first organization allows us to build an exceptional team composed of makers and sellers with diverse backgrounds and skill sets from around the globe. Our default work culture is asynchronous and emphasizes written communication to prioritize maker time, focus and company productivity. Our goal is not to eliminate face-to-face interaction, but we should default to a setting where written documentation is so strong that a meeting on most project subject matters would seem odd.Â Â </p><p dir=""ltr"">Founded in 2022, and backed by prominent venture firms including IA Ventures, Tuesday Capital, and B Capital Group, this is a unique opportunity to join this band of misfits on the ground floor. As an early teammate you will be working intimately with the founding team, who has done 0 to 1 five times over while seeing four of them come to an exit.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The <strong>Application Engineer</strong> will become an integral member of an intimate 9-person team consisting of:</p><ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maker #7 (Application Engineer, You!)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maker #6 (Melissa, Implementation Specialist)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maker #5 (Michel, Frontend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maker #4 (Lucas, Frontend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maker #3 (Jose, Fullstack Engineer)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maker #2 (Hyder, Backend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maker #1 (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennismortensen"">Dennis</a>, Founder)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Seller #1 (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuacpeacock/"">Josh</a>, Co-founder)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Helper #1 (Vibeke)</p></li></ul><p dir=""ltr"">However, we are looking not just for an Engineer but, rather, a teammate we see as integral to LaunchBrightlyâs long-term journey and vital to our success. Someone who is comfortable in the dark and who sees a certain romance, like we do, in embracing the unknowns that come with being on the startup journey. We have a track record of seeing those colleagues who join us on the ground floor of our ventures ride the startup journey to completion (exit) with us, as we grow and become successful together. This is something we take seriously, and something we are extremely proud of!Â </p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Job Description</h2><p dir=""ltr"">You'll work with Jose (and the remainder of the team) on the logic layer that powers our product: workflows, task runners, state machines, rules engines, and orchestration. You'll work in Typescript directly in the Vue App, and often in JS in AWS Lambdaâs, tune our data models, and shape how primary product features like Audits function behind the scenes. You're not building APIs or UI â you're building the actual product behavior. Think of yourself as a Product Logic &amp; State Orchestration Engineer.Â </p><p dir=""ltr"">This is a hands-on role for an engineer who loves building reliable systems that model real-world processes. Youâll work on the internal state machines that govern how screenshots flow through the system, are transformed, enhanced, and delivered. Youâll define rules engines that let non-technical users control automated behavior, manage task orchestration across Lambda and queues, and shape our schema design to handle complex edge cases with clarity and performance in mind.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Youâll thrive in this role if you think deeply about how complex systems behave over time, have strong opinions on data modeling and event-driven workflows, and enjoy writing deterministic, testable, observable logic. If you care more about product behavior than presentation, and love turning business intent into robust execution â this is for you!</p><h2 dir=""ltr"">We are looking for previous experience working with</h2><ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Building production-grade B2B web apps, including everything that comes with robust, scalable software: business logic, testing, observability, and performance.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Writing TypeScript in a modern frontend architecture (Vue 3 SPA) and JavaScript in AWS Lambda functions.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Working deeply to create meaningful and maintainable test coverage across core business logic (e.g. Vitest).</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Designing and modeling robust data schemas for DynamoDB and GraphQL queries, with a strong intuition for how data shapes product behavior.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Consuming and reviewing internal APIs using Postman, and contributing clear, actionable feedback to improve them.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Implementing Serverless architecture with AWS Amplify, including event-driven flows and task orchestration.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Having a good functional understanding of UI-layer concerns (HTML, DOM, TailwindCSS, HeadlessUI), but focusing your energy on what happens beneath the surface â the orchestration, rules, and workflows that make the app tick.</p></li></ul><h2 dir=""ltr"">What you bring to the table</h2><ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Minimum of 3 years of industry experience</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">A customer-first mentality, with an instinct to imagine how users will react and interact</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Strong and precise communication and documentation skills, with a will to understand and be understood</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Prides themselves on writing highly readable, thoroughly tested code</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">The personal organization skills and patience to manage multiple contexts as projects and features come together.
